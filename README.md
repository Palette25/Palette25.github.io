#Palette Blog

## Decration

My name is Palette, and this blog object template is forked from its owner ---- Hux

## Usage

As to myself, I just use this blog template to white my own things, in other words ---- find a way to say something, 
and I hope that this blog can be a slicent place for me to say what I want to, instead of copying or stealing....

## Finally

Thanks to author Hux, though I don't know him, but it's bad to just copy your template. Hope you can understand....
