> Yet another man.


Hi, I am Palette, a software engineering student studying in SYSU. If you have a chance to look at my blog, hope that you will enjoy the contains and contact me if necesssary.

To be honest, as a ordinary student studying in Web or maybe HTML, CSS or JavaScript, I don't know so much professional knowledge about them, due to the lack of studying and background.

All in all, I hope to be more excellent in the future, and I will keep updateing the blogs about the things that I have learned.

Keep moving~~~~~
